    <id>https://example.com/blog/about%20my...absent%20love%20life/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hey! this is a sad,sad,sad entry about how my love life is gone...&lt;/strong&gt;
hey! i wont go into THAT much detail, but... i am a minor,  sooo like, none of these ppl were/are adults, pls dont be jerks to them in your minds?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okee, my first boyfriend- &amp;quot;E&amp;quot; we dated in the 5th grade, and... he kinda rlly sucked... when we first started dating, i had a stalker, so i asked him not to tell a bunch of people, ya know, so that i, or he, would not get hurt... you know the first thing that he did? he ran right up to my stalker,&amp;quot;J&amp;quot;, and yelled &amp;quot;guess who gt the girl, huh! i did!&amp;quot; and said more stuff along these lines... like, WTF?? ugh... ok- he also bet on me without my permission, and more stuff like that-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so, about anouther partener i had, me and her dated for, like three years, but with lots of breaks. (i dated &amp;quot;E&amp;quot; during one of these times) this partener- &amp;quot;K&amp;quot; was pretty awesome! exept for this one fact- she was 2 years older, and we started dating in... 4th grade? soo, she was going through mental changes i wasnt- it got... uncomftorable when she started thinking about, ya&#39;know, sex. also, during our time together, we had a poly relationship wih this other girl- who was also 2 years older than me, and also rlly sucked... AND during our time together, her older sister asked me out, sooo i, like the horrible nieve 5th grader i was... dated both of them(with their permission). during this time, i was also manipulated into sex by this older sister, who was &lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt; years older than me...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to the next one! k, so ima go into more detail about one of the girls i dated while dating &amp;quot;K&amp;quot;(poly). lets call her &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; she was 2 years older than me, and super toxic. before me and &amp;quot;K&amp;quot; dated, me and &amp;quot;K&amp;quot; were super good friends, and &amp;quot;K&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; were also good friends, though not to my and &amp;quot;K&amp;quot;&#39;s level. &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; was jelous, and decided to try and make me and &amp;quot;K&amp;quot; not be friends... she did this through stuff like telling me that &amp;quot;K&amp;quot; messaged her saying that she wanted me dead... and a few other things that i dont quite remember. AND I STILL DATED &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; WHEN SHE ASKED ME OUT?!?!? i was an IDIOT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ok! to &amp;quot;K&amp;quot;&#39;s older sister! my relationship with &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; was very short, but in that time i was still manipulated into having sex. it sucked, and once again, &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; was &lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt; years older than me- thats A LOT. (i was in 5th grade when i dataed them, so &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; was in 9th grade...) yep. thats F##### up, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ok, to the last person ive dated- &amp;quot;M&amp;quot;. when me and her dated, i was in 6th grade, and really wanted a partner. thus, i helped a Q bisexual out? our relationship was short, and not so sweet. she broke up with me for two days, after dating for about two weeks, then dated for about a month before i broke up with her for good. i still feel guilty for this reltionship- i kinda led her on... ugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;so! thanks for reading this! it helped me to proccess all of the trauma related to these relationships... im sorry if any small childeren read this and started crying (i cried while wrighting this)... btw, ima make longer postes, and have no real scedule, though it&#39;ll be more regualr as it summer vaycay!! bye! see yall next post!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hi! in this second post abt making gacha channels, i am gonna talk abt how to make the videos! now, this is coming from &lt;em&gt;MY&lt;/em&gt; experience, so it will be a different from your experence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prepare for the screenshots! unless you have &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of storage, know that you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be deleting the screenshots after the video is made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; have to make things like a profile pic, headrer, and watermark! these are all things tha make you noticable, and noticeable is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;pretty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; inportent when making videos!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;have a app, or site, to make the videos on! i use capcut, but i may switch soon, as it is getting banned on the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;thats all the advice i have for you today, i hope that any aspiring gachatubers reading find this helpfull!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;update&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;capcut is not getting banned, but i am switching to kinemaster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>how to start a gacha channel!</title>
    <link href="https://example.com/blog/howtostartagachachannel/" />
    <updated>2025-01-19T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://example.com/blog/howtostartagachachannel/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ok! so, you want to start a gacha channel? here are some quick tips:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;figure out your vein of content! are you into FNAF? harry potter? attack on titan? or, are you stand-alone, making completely original content with only your ocs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make some characters in that are in that fandom, or your own personal ocs! preferably both if you make fan content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have a set theme: do you make meme videos? mini-movies? music videos? or do you want to make trends?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you want to go rouge and do none of this, thats also perfecly fine!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;thanks for looking at this list, please know that all of this is my personal opinion, do not be mean to me please!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
