**hey! this is a sad,sad,sad entry about how my love life is gone...**
hey! i wont go into THAT much detail, but... i am a minor,  sooo like, none of these ppl were/are adults, pls dont be jerks to them in your minds?

okee, my first boyfriend- "E" we dated in the 5th grade, and... he kinda rlly sucked... when we first started dating, i had a stalker, so i asked him not to tell a bunch of people, ya know, so that i, or he, would not get hurt... you know the first thing that he did? he ran right up to my stalker,"J", and yelled "guess who gt the girl, huh! i did!" and said more stuff along these lines... like, WTF?? ugh... ok- he also bet on me without my permission, and more stuff like that- 

so, about anouther partener i had, me and her dated for, like three years, but with lots of breaks. (i dated "E" during one of these times) this partener- "K" was pretty awesome! exept for this one fact- she was 2 years older, and we started dating in... 4th grade? soo, she was going through mental changes i wasnt- it got... uncomftorable when she started thinking about, ya'know, sex. also, during our time together, we had a poly relationship wih this other girl- who was also 2 years older than me, and also rlly sucked... AND during our time together, her older sister asked me out, sooo i, like the horrible nieve 5th grader i was... dated both of them(with their permission). during this time, i was also manipulated into sex by this older sister, who was **4** years older than me...

to the next one! k, so ima go into more detail about one of the girls i dated while dating "K"(poly). lets call her "C" she was 2 years older than me, and super toxic. before me and "K" dated, me and "K" were super good friends, and "K" and "C" were also good friends, though not to my and "K"'s level. "C" was jelous, and decided to try and make me and "K" not be friends... she did this through stuff like telling me that "K" messaged her saying that she wanted me dead... and a few other things that i dont quite remember. AND I STILL DATED "C" WHEN SHE ASKED ME OUT?!?!? i was an IDIOT.

ok! to "K"'s older sister! my relationship with "A" was very short, but in that time i was still manipulated into having sex. it sucked, and once again, "A" was **4** years older than me- thats A LOT. (i was in 5th grade when i dataed them, so "A" was in 9th grade...) yep. thats F##### up, right? 

ok, to the last person ive dated- "M". when me and her dated, i was in 6th grade, and really wanted a partner. thus, i helped a Q bisexual out? our relationship was short, and not so sweet. she broke up with me for two days, after dating for about two weeks, then dated for about a month before i broke up with her for good. i still feel guilty for this reltionship- i kinda led her on... ugh.

**so! thanks for reading this! it helped me to proccess all of the trauma related to these relationships... im sorry if any small childeren read this and started crying (i cried while wrighting this)... btw, ima make longer postes, and have no real scedule, though it'll be more regualr as it summer vaycay!! bye! see yall next post!**
